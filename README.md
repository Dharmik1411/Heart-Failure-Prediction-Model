# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and predicts heart failure using machine learning techniques. The project aims to provide insights into the features associated with heart failure and develop predictive models for identifying patients at risk.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is related to heart failure and includes features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Smoking
- Diabetes
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Other medical parameters related to heart health

## Features

The notebook includes the following key features:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Summary statistics
   - Data visualization
   - Feature analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

3. **Model Building:**
   - Training and testing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   - Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Insights and Visualization:**
   - Analysis of important features.
   - Visual representation of model performance.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-failure-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-failure-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart-Failure.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and build predictive models.

## Results

The notebook provides:

- A detailed analysis of factors contributing to heart failure.
- Predictive models with performance metrics for evaluation.
- Visualizations to aid understanding of the data and model outcomes.
